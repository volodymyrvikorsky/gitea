# Reporting security issues

The Gitea maintainers take security seriously.  
If you discover a security issue, please bring it to their attention right away!

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **DO NOT** file a public issue, instead send your report privately to `security@gitea.io`.

Security reports are greatly appreciated and we will publicly thank you for it, although we keep your name confidential if you request it.
