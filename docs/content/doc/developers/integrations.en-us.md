# Integrations

Gitea has a wonderful community of third-party integrations, as well as first-class support in various other
projects.

We are curating a list over at [awesome-gitea](https://gitea.com/gitea/awesome-gitea) to track these!

If you are looking for [CI/CD](https://gitea.com/gitea/awesome-gitea#devops),
an [SDK](https://gitea.com/gitea/awesome-gitea#sdk),
or even some extra [themes](https://gitea.com/gitea/awesome-gitea#themes),
you can find them listed in the [awesome-gitea](https://gitea.com/gitea/awesome-gitea) repository!
