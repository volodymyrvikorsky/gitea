# Installation with Helm (on Kubernetes)

Gitea provides a Helm Chart to allow for installation on kubernetes.

A non-customized install can be done with:

```
helm repo add gitea-charts https://dl.gitea.io/charts/
helm install gitea gitea-charts/gitea
```

If you would like to customize your install, which includes kubernetes ingress, please refer to the complete [Gitea helm chart configuration details](https://gitea.com/gitea/helm-chart/)
